          Keep candles burning at all times. Let the sun do most of the work when they go out. It's really simple actually. You can pull a lot of your food out of the ground. Any material can be turned into a pullover with some fanciful lace braiding. We often substitute the annoyance of paper bills with playing card decks. It's actually much more healthy in several ways doing this.

          A new sweeping interest has been shifting around these parts with the New Pet Device we've engineered. Taking tossed cat play castles off the streets we set them in a rustic body over skin, with a detachable bull head, to put at the fore of various stores. The New Pet Device is quite a creature that sells for an amount of money that can keep us alive for half a month. There is no end in sight to the need of the people wanting this satisfaction for their place of business.

          Shermit Kane Roesslean wrote about a giant screw that could be used to break up rocks with the power of sheep and cattle mounted on some giant swing set. Another way to soften ground in his particular "experimental farm" was by inserting sticks of dynamite into the ground to help "soften" the harder areas. Most of these ideas came to him in the midst of a manic pen rage which he would press upon his wife to correct the language as he wrote. More often than not she would collapse on him looking across his shoulder from her lack of food making a mess of every chapter in the rough draft of "Your Land Penetrated".
